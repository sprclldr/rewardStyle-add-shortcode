rewardStyle-add-shortcode
=========================

rewardStyle gives you the shortcode script for WordPress posts, but without a plugin or function in your self-hosted WordPress site, the widget won't render (it just outputs the raw shortcode). This is a function to put in your functions.php file to render the shortcode correctly.
